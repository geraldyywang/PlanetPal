## 💡 Inspiration💡

According to the City of Toronto, "contaminated recycling is currently costing the City millions annually. Approximately one third of what is put in the Blue Bin doesn’t belong there or was ruined as a result of the wrong items being put into the bin." Missing out on being able to recycle one third of what is put in the Blue Bin is huge, especially when this issue can be solved by spreading more actionable awareness to the city's residents. Furthermore, Toronto cannot be the only place in the world that is having these issues. Thus, it becomes increasingly important for us to become mindful citizens of the world we inhabit, for the benefit of our communities and most importantly, for the wildlife and world around us!

## ? What is PlanetPal ?

PlanetPal is a gamified recycling app that is designed to promote good recycling habits and spread more awareness about recycling correctly. Users subscribe to the app monthly, paying upwards of $10 per month, where every time they recycle, they build progress to recovering the money put towards their description. When the user completes a threshold of recycling per month, not only are they refunded their money, but are also awarded with a limited monthly challenge badge that displays their dedication to the environment. Users are given recycling instructions when they take a picture of their trash, their trash is classified with a CNN into 6 categories. The user is then told how to recycle the item that they are holding. After disposing of the item, the user gains progress towards the monthly challenge.
